# Gexf Primer 1.3
GEXF Primer is a non-normative document intended to provide an easily readable description of the GEXF facilities, and is oriented towards quickly understanding how to create GEXF documents. This primer describes the language features through examples which are complemented by references to normative texts. Specification is in [RelaxNG Compact](http://relaxng.org/compact-tutorial-20030326.html) grammar.

## Introduction
This document, GEXF Primer, provides an description of GEXF, and should be used alongside the formal descriptions of the language contained in the GEXF specification. The intended audience of this document includes application developers whose programs read and write GEXF files, and users who want to communicate with programs using GEXF import/export. The text assumes that you have a basic understanding of XML 1.1 and  XML-Namespaces. Basic knowledge of XML Schema is also assumed for some parts of this document. Each major section of the primer introduces new features of the language, and describes those features in the context of concrete examples.

Section 2 covers the basic mechanisms of GEXF. It describes how to declare a simple graph by defining its nodes and edges and how to add simple user data to the graph.

Section 3 describes dynamic graph model.

Section 4 describes mechanisms for extending GEXF to add specific data with the Visualization module in example.

The primer is a non-normative document, which means that it does not provide a definitive specification of the GEXF language. The examples and other explanatory material in this document are provided to help you understand GEXF, but they may not always provide definitive answers. In such cases, you will need to refer to the GEXF specification, and to help you do this, we provide many links pointing to the relevant parts of the specification.
